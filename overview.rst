HiPFiSH is essentially a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for IPFS.

You use HiPFiSH to ensure files are available in many locations and served to clients with low latency and high bandwidth.

HiPFiSH can be managed through it's web site or via it's REST API. There is also a command line tool (the "hipfish console"), which is a REST API client.
