Authentication
==============

Access to the HiPFiSH API is controlled via API tokens. These can be managed via the Web UI.

TODO:
 * insert screen shots and HOWTO for API token management and account management
 * feature specification for API token management and account management
 * would we ever use the API to manage API tokens (how to bootstrap it - would require account creation, credit card etc, the whole thing?)
